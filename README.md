## install tailwind 

Is even easier if you use a plugin to install tailwind

in console

```
vue add @ianaya89/tailwind
```

If you prefer to use the vue ui dashboard you can do it by: 

- clicking on plugins section, 
- then click on green button to search plugin
- then in the searchbox write tailwind and scroll to find the "@ianaya89/vue-cli-plugin-tailwind"
- select it and it will start to download and add the config files
- finally click on finalize and go to serve option and reestart the server
